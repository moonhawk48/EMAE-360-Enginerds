All the commands that this website uses are for bash so you should use that program to setup git.

All you have to do on this is to follow the parts about your identity.

Download the github desktop app from the github website and sign in with your github account.  copy the link to the github page and paste it in where it says to clone repository.  follow the prompts from there, and when everything is set up, chose open in explorer to see the files in file explorer.

if you change files, make sure to press the button that says push the files to the repository.
